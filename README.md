 ADVERSTISEMENT SALES PREDICTION FROM EXISTING CUSTOMER USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION
 
##  About
This model is a classification model since there are two classes in the dataset, that is 0 or 1 , which means that the customer will not buy or buy respectively.

## About Dataset
```
Rows = 1000
Cols = 3
Input = Age, Salary
Output = Purchase or not purchase ( Class)
```

## Steps involved

* Load and Summarize data 
* Segregating the dataset into X and Y
* Splitting Dataset to train and test
* Feature Scaling : Since the features have different scales, there is a chance that higher weightage is given to features with higher magnitude. This could bias our algorithm. Hence, we have to scale our data to make all our features contribute equally to the result.
* Use of Logistic Regression Algorithm to train the model.
* Then , finally observing how our model is classifying the new data.

## Accuracy attained
